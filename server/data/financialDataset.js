    response: `Creating a budget is fundamental to financial health. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. Calculate your total monthly income from all sources
2. List all fixed expenses (rent, utilities, insurance, minimum debt payments)
3. List variable expenses (groceries, entertainment, dining out)
4. Set savings goals (emergency fund, retirement, specific targets)
5. Allocate remaining funds to discretionary spending
6. Track your spending throughout the month
7. Adjust your budget as needed based on actual spending

A good rule of thumb is the 50/30/20 rule:
- 50% for needs (rent, utilities, groceries)
- 30% for wants (entertainment, dining out)
- 20% for savings and debt repayment

Budgeting tools:
- Apps: Mint, YNAB (You Need A Budget), PocketGuard

    ],
    response: `An emergency fund is crucial for financial stability. Here's what you need to know:

1. Target amount: 3-6 months of essential expenses
2. Start small: Even $500-$1,000 can cover minor emergencies
3. Keep it liquid: Store in a high-yield savings account for easy access
4. Separate account: Keep it distinct from regular savings
5. Replenish after use: If you use it, prioritize rebuilding it

An emergency fund protects you from:
- Unexpected medical expenses
- Job loss
- Car repairs
- Home maintenance issues
- Other unforeseen costs

Avoid using it for planned expenses like vacations or holiday gifts.

Where to keep your emergency fund:
- High-yield savings account (currently 4-5% APY)
- Money market account
- Short-term CDs (Certificates of Deposit)
- I Bonds (inflation-protected savings bonds)`

      "student loans",
      "debt repayment",
      "debt consolidation",
      "get out of debt"
    ],
    response: `Effective debt management strategies include:

1. List all debts with balances and interest rates
2. Choose a repayment strategy:
   - Debt Snowball: Pay minimums on all debts, extra on smallest balance
   - Debt Avalanche: Pay minimums on all debts, extra on highest interest rate
3. Consider consolidation or refinancing for high-interest debts
4. Negotiate lower interest rates with creditors
5. Avoid taking on new debt while repaying existing debt

Prioritize high-interest debt (credit cards) over low-interest debt (student loans, mortgages). Making more than minimum payments significantly reduces the time and interest paid.

Debt repayment methods:
- Snowball method: Quick wins build momentum
- Avalanche method: Mathematically optimal, saves more money
- Debt consolidation: Single payment at lower interest rate
- Balance transfer: Move high-interest debt to lower-rate cards

If struggling with debt:
- Contact creditors to discuss payment plans
- Consider credit counseling services
- Explore debt management plans
- As a last resort, bankruptcy (consult an attorney)`
